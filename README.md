# Self-Organised Language Agents (SOLA) framework

ðŸš€ Coming Soon â€“ end February 2025 / beginning March 2025 ðŸš€

This repository will host the Self-Organised Language Agents (SOLA) framework, fka Language-Cellular Automata, which aim to study self-organization in artificial systems using Large Language Model (LLM) agents. 
SOLA enables multi-agent simulations where agents perceive, update, and communicate through language-based interactions.
